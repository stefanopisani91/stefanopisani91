# Hi there, I'm Stefano 👋

### 🧬 Bridging Clinical Medicine, Biology & Data Science

I am a **Data Analyst and Bioinformatician** with a unique trajectory. Coming from a strong foundational background in Clinical Medicine at an Italian university and currently advancing my studies in Biology, I specialize in transforming complex health and biological data into actionable, software-driven insights. 

I possess a true **"cultural bilingualism"** between healthcare and technology. Having nearly completed a medical degree and passed numerous advanced clinical exams, I fluently speak the language of medicine. Today, I translate that deep clinical intuition into the technical languages of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

My philosophy is simple: **You can't engineer what you don't understand.** I use my clinical knowledge to define the *"Why"* and modern AI-Assisted Engineering to build the *"How"*.

### 🚀 What I do
- **HealthTech Development:** Architecting Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) that mimic real-world medical reasoning.
- **Data Analysis & Synthetic Data:** Handling complex datasets, ensuring GDPR compliance through statistical generation of synthetic patient cohorts.
- **AI Orchestration:** Leveraging LLM agents to accelerate coding, bridging the gap between clinical theory and scalable software deployment.

### 🌟 Featured Project: NeuroDiag-AI
I recently built a probabilistic diagnostic tool trained on 10,000 synthetic patients, featuring an "Onion Triage" architecture to mimic a clinician's differential diagnosis process.
